Hangman game, my first javascript, jquey, css and html project

The game generates a random word from an array of words. The word is passed into a word checker to see if it was already used. If the word was already used the, another word is chosen from the array and checked until a word that wasn't used is found. After a word is successfully selected the word is replaced with dashes which are dispalyed. The player is presented with 26 buttons representing each letter of the alphabet, the word to guess represented by dashes. The is a score board to the left of the screen which get update by 1 for every word solved. There is a gallow that will eventually display a hanging sprite once there are 6 unsuccessful guess before the word is solved. The right of the screen displays the moves remaining. Once the player choses a letter the corresponding buttons is disabled. If the player is able to guess the word before losing all moves, their score is update by 1, another word is given and buttons are restored. On the other hand if the player runs out of moves a message pops up stating no more moves, a new word is give and moves are reset to 6.
